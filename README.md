# Modal Test

This is a test setup to make a Bootstrap modal that:

1. Loads remote content using jQuery.load rather than the depreciated Bootstrap modal remote option.
2. Changes the browser URL when a modal is opened or closed.

See `index.html` for the markup and `/js/scripts.js` for the javascript. Requires Bootstrap and jQuery.
